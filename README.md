# Signal and Image Processing repository
# Course taught on the first half of 2020

> This is a set of Jupyter Notebooks which explore signal and image processing using Python, and libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, and Scikit-Learn.

### Features

- Hough transform (detect airport lanes)
- Grab Cut algorithm (segment car and face from their backgrounds)

### Code Sample

```python
#Parameters
mask = np.zeros(img1.shape[:2], np.uint8)
bgModel = np.zeros((1,65), np.float64)
fgModel = np.zeros((1,65), np.float64)
rectangle = p1+p2
```
